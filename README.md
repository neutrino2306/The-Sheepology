## Why Sheep?

Liszt’s father was literally a shepherd.

In his diaries, Liszt described himself as having an “extremely sheeplike character.”

In letters, Liszt often referred to himself as “the very docile sheep of your valley” or even signed off as “Your old sheep, FL.”

Princess de Sayn nicknamed him Bon Besson (B.B.), literally “lamb twin.”
