# 🐑 Sheepology: The Study of Franz Liszt

> *“Your old sheep, FL.”* — Franz Liszt

## What is Sheepology?

**Sheepology** is a playful name for the study of **Franz Liszt (1811–1886)**.
This repository collects resources, references, and research materials about Liszt — his life, works, writings, letters, and cultural impact.

## Why Sheep?

From the beginning, Liszt’s father Adam Liszt (1776–1827) was employed as an Ovium rationista (shepherd).

Therefore, Liszt later wrote in his diary:
> "In my childhood, I saw tens of **thousands of sheep**. This may be due to my extremely **sheeplike character**."

In his letters, he often referred to himself as a sheep (see the following excerpts from different letters):
> FL has no such ambitions and would be very happy if you would be willing to consider him as the very docile sheep of your valley.
> M. FL will try to follow the recommendation of the most illustrious Olgh, and will do all he can to become as "gentil" as a little sheep.

He even signed his letters as "**Your old sheep, FL**."

Princess de Sayn nicknamed him **Bon Besson**, literally "**lamb twin**", and Liszt often signed his letters as **B.B**.

One learns with a certain amusement of the rebuke administered to him at the first philosophy class, to which he turned up late. "Gentlemen, you will kindly be here punctually at the start of each lesson," the lecturer said. Professor Choisy, remarked reprovingly, as he bestowed a severe look upon the errant and unknown newcomer. **Sheepishly**, Liszt bowed his apologies.

Last but not least, he was born in 1811, the Year of the Sheep in the Chinese zodiac.

In conclusion, Liszt was — quite literally and figuratively — a sheep.
