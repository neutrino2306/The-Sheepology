# 🐑 Sheepology: The Study of Franz Liszt

> *“Your old sheep, FL.”* — Franz Liszt

## What is Sheepology?

**Sheepology** is a playful name for the study of **Franz Liszt (1811–1886)**.
This repository collects resources, references, and research materials about Liszt — his life, works, writings, letters, and cultural impact.

## Why Sheep?

From the very beginning, Liszt’s life was tied to sheep. His father, **Adam Liszt (1776–1827)**, worked as an *Ovium rationista* (shepherd).

Later, Liszt himself wrote in his diary:
> *"In my childhood, I saw tens of thousands of sheep. This may be due to my extremely sheeplike character."*

Throughout his life, Liszt often referred to himself as a sheep in his correspondence:
> *"FL has no such ambitions and would be very happy if you would be willing to consider him as the very docile sheep of your valley."*  
> *"M. FL will try to follow the recommendation of the most illustrious Olgh, and will do all he can to become as ‘gentil’ as a little sheep."*

He even signed some letters as:
> *"Your old sheep, FL."*

His friends joined in the metaphor. Princess de Sayn nicknamed him **Bon Besson** (*"lamb twin"*), and Liszt frequently signed his letters simply **B.B.**

The sheep imagery extended beyond Liszt’s own self-descriptions.
For example, when he attended his first philosophy lecture at university, he arrived late and was immediately reprimanded by the professor.  

> *One learns with a certain amusement of the rebuke administered to him at the first philosophy class, to which he turned up late. "Gentlemen, you will kindly be here punctually at the start of each lesson," the lecturer said. Professor Choisy, remarked reprovingly, as he bestowed a severe look upon the errant and unknown newcomer. Sheepishly, Liszt bowed his apologies.*  

Finally, Liszt was born in **1811**, which, according to the Chinese zodiac, was the **Year of the Sheep**.

**In conclusion, Liszt was — quite literally and figuratively — a sheep.**

Liszt carried many identities throughout his life — **composer, pianist, conductor, teacher, writer, thinker, and even Abbé Liszt**.  
Yet, alongside all these roles, he sometimes described himself simply as a **sheep**.  

**Sheepology** embraces this paradox: to explore Liszt in all his dimensions, both grand and humble.
